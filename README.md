Walkie: the companion app for an automated dog walker.

"Our product, Walkie, is a dog walking robot that automates walking dogs. Its companion app provides users the ability to walk their dogs anywhere and anytime. Users can create walking routes, schedule walks for the future, and assign walks to one or more of their dogs. They can also monitor and interact with the dog(s) during the walk. The app provides data visualization that show the status of the current walk, including a live video feed and the location of their dog(s). The app also includes other safety features provided by the robot that the user can set."
